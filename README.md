## Balkan C-19

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

### `Description`

Balkan c-19 displays covid-19 data provided by https://corona-api.com/countries<br/>
for Western Balkans using [recharts library](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/BarChart).

### `Folder Structure`

Very simple

### `TODO`

Find better API for data.<br/>
This site is terrible.
